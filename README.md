## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to identify optimal solutions to the challenges faced by travelers and develop strategies to enhance the services provided by various airlines. By conducting sentiment analysis on traveler feedback, we aim to extract valuable insights from the dataset to understand customer sentiments and experiences.

Through this analysis, we will evaluate the sentiment data contained within the provided dataframe, uncovering patterns and trends that can inform actionable recommendations. Ultimately, our objective is to improve the overall travel experience by addressing the concerns and preferences of passengers, thereby contributing to the strategic development of airline facilities and services.

## Dataset Description
Number of rows=1300+,Number of columns=19,The dataset includes detail about  aircraft , traveller_type , seat_type , route , date_flown , recommended 3 , trip_verified , rating , seat_comfort , cabin_staff_service , food_beverages , ground_service , value_for_money , entertainment

## Project Workflow
Here first we will know about sentimental analysis

### What is Sentimental Analysis
Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral. Today, companies have large volumes of text data like emails, customer support chat transcripts, social media comments, and reviews. Sentiment analysis tools can scan this text to automatically determine the author’s attitude towards a topic. Companies use the insights from sentiment analysis to improve customer service and increase brand reputation. 

### How does it work?
Sentiment analysis is an application of natural language processing (NLP) technologies that train computer software to understand text in ways similar to humans. The analysis typically goes through several stages before providing the final result.

#### Preprocessing
During the preprocessing stage, sentiment analysis identifies key words to highlight the core message of the text.Tokenization breaks a sentence into several elements or tokens.Lemmatization converts words into their root form. For example, the root form of am is be.Stop-word removal filters out words that don't add meaningful value to the sentence. For example, with, for, at, and of are stop words.
