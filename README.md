The primary goal of this project is to identify optimal solutions to the challenges faced by travelers and develop strategies to enhance the services provided by various airlines. By conducting sentiment analysis on traveler feedback, we aim to extract valuable insights from the dataset to understand customer sentiments and experiences.

Ultimately, our objective is to improve the overall travel experience by addressing the concerns and preferences of passengers, thereby contributing to the strategic development of airline facilities and services.
